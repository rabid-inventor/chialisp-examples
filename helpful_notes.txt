If you are interested, I developed some singleton inner puzzle that can be owned by a user and transferred to another user, optionally by paying for it in XCH.

The paid transfer can be initiated by both a seller or a buyer, by partially signing a spend bundle.
The other party can then complete the signature and submit the transaction to the blockchain.

The chialisp code can be found here, I'd love to get some feedback on it:

thanks so much that really helped me debug thou it has taken a while clisp has some pretty strange nuances.
